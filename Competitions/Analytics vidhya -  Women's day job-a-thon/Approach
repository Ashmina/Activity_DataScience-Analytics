There was no missing values in the dataset. As examined using box plots, there was some outliers in two columns and I didnâ€™t consider them as outliers as that values seems to be valid for those two columns. 
I used pandas dummy encoder for encoding the categorical features as that method was easy to implement. I have done standard scaling on numerical columns. 
I have tried some models on the test data. And got a higher accuracy for random forest classifier. So I used that model for predicting labels for test data.
